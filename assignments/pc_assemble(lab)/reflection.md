From the PC Assemble Lab, I have gained significant hands-on experience as this was the first time I can assemble and troubleshoot a computer system while working as a group with different people. For example, I have learned the way to install and connect the components inside the PC in a step-by-step manner such as the case, CPU, RAM, hard drive, power supply, cooling fan and internal cables. Besides, I have also understood the functionality of each hardware component in order to ensure the proper operation of the computer system. However, I believe the lab could be enhanced by providing more time for assembling and troubleshooting. Apart from that, different PCs that have different configurations could also provided to each group so that every students can experience and handle other hardware components that are modern. In overall, it is undeniable that my teamwork and communication skills are also improved during this activities, especially communicate with foreign students in order to separate our tasks. In addition, my practical knowledge was strengthened and it enables me to be more confident when handling computer hardware.
